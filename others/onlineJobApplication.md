<h2>The truth about online job applications:</h2>
<ul>
<li>For one job posting, on average, 1,000 individuals will see the job post, 200 will begin the application process, 
100 will complete the application, 75 of those 100 resumes will be screened out by either the Applicant Tracking System or a recruiter, 
25 resumes will be seen by the hiring manager, 4 to 6 will be invited for an interview, 1 to 3 of them will be invited back for final interview, 
1 will be offered that job, and 80 per cent of those receiving an offer will accept it.</li>
<li>61% of hires are from company career pages and employee referrals.</li> 
<li>1 in 10 personal referrals are hired; 1 in 219 candidates found from online job boards are hired. 
<li>Only 1 in every 6 external hires is attributed to a job board (18.1%).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applying Online FAQs</h2>
<h3>How should I handle online applications?</h3>
Remember, only 14%-18% of hires are made from job board postings and only 1 in 219 online applicants are hired (compare that to the 1 in 10 personal referrals that are hired!). 
Thus, it’s critical that you network and follow up after submitting an online application to increase your chances of standing out from the large pool of applicants.

<ul>
<li>BEFORE you apply, look for contacts in the organisation using your LinkedIn network to see if you know anyone who could assist in submitting you for the role internally. Ask them what the process is to do so.</li>
<li>If you don’t have a direct contact in the organisation, follow up after your application by reaching out to the recruiter and/or hiring manager for the role via LinkedIn and/or direct email. For instructions on how to 
  find these contacts and examples of the message you should send, check out our resources on finding key contacts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How can I stand a chance against all the people who apply for a posted job?</h3>
Don’t wait until an open position is posted to apply on a company’s career page. Recruiters begin looking for candidates before positions are even posted! 
Register and post your resume within all of your target companies’ Applicant Tracking Systems so you’ll be in their database when they search for candidates. 
Company career pages are becoming increasingly popular as sources to pull candidates from, combined with internal referral processes. 
Be sure to refresh your resume regularly with additional details and information including new skills you have developed or trainings you have completed.

<h3>How do I deal with the salary question on online applications?</h3>
Online applications will often ask for your desired or expected salary, or even request a salary history for your previous positions. You have three options when faced with this, choose whichever feels most comfortable for you:

**Option 1** When at all possible, leave this blank, or enter ‘negotiable’ or ‘will discuss.’

**Option 2** If the application forces you to give a number, give exactly as asked. Provide your salary history and enter your expected salary (if it will allow for a range do so). This option will ensure your information is accurate. The downside of this option is that companies may make decisions that are not necessarily in your favour based on this information.

**Option 3** The riskiest option, but one that is gaining popularity, is listing your (researched) target salary in every salary box (or better yet, a range if the system will allow it). Then, in the first open text box write: "all salary figures reported reflect my current salary target." This helps to prevent the image that you’re lying or being unethical. The downside of this option is that some recruiters/companies may not appreciate it. The upside, if the company accepts it, is that this strategy allows you to put the focus on what your expectations are instead of what you made previously.

<h3>How do I answer essay questions on an online application?</h3>
Many companies now ask questions in the application process that require a longer response. Be sure to take these seriously and compose a well-written answer.

<li>Find out how many characters or words you can work with. If the application does not provide this information up front, paste a large amount of text into the box and see where it cuts off. 
  Make sure your response is not much shorter or longer than the employer expects or requests.</li>
<li>Double-check your work. Write your responses in Microsoft Word before pasting them into the application. Carefully review all spelling and grammar, 
  just as you would for a resume or cover letter. Your communication skills will be judged by what you write!</li>
  
<h3>What if I want to apply for more than one job at a company?</h3>
Applying for more than one position within an organisation may create the image that you’re a bit scattered, unfocused, or not being strategic about what you want in your career—not great selling points for your first impression! 
If a company has more than one position you’re interested in, try to gain more information before submitting your resume.

<li>Reach out to connections and recruiters at the company and request a brief call to learn more about what they’re looking for in each role and the status of each job opening. 
  There are a lot of details often left unsaid in job postings and some roles may be inactive or close to being filled already. And of course networking is the #1 way to get noticed anyhow!</li>
<li>If you’re unable to connect and learn more about the opportunities, apply to the job that you most closely fit the requirements and qualifications for. 
  Even if it’s not the one you are most interested in, you’ll be more likely to receive a call back for it. At that time you may ask questions and discuss the roles with a recruiter.</li>


<h3>What if I have some "red flags" in my background such as job-hopping or a criminal record?</h3>
We all have shortcomings, but you may need to make a special effort if there is something in your background that is haunting your job search, such as little related experience, 
a history of job-hopping, a criminal record, or other potential deal-breakers.

<li>Be honest. Acknowledge your shortcomings and mistakes, and what you’ve learned from them. Don’t make excuses or lay the blame on others. Let employers know what is different for you now.</li>
<li>Make up for your shortcomings. Build related experience through pro-bono consulting, give back to your community through volunteering, and complete some free webinars or courses in your field. 
  Show that you’re committed to being the best you can be for your future employer.</li>
<li>Network, network, network! If your resume typically falls flat on its own, networking can help you get past being just a piece of paper. Many times it’s not what you know but who you know.</li>
